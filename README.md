# Women In Tech Summit

Hi Developers! This is where all of our work for the website will be maintained. For those who are curious, I
initialized the React app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This README should
give you some info as you start working on it.

Don't hesitate to message Uzair or I (Teddy) o Slack if you have any question!

## Page Design

It would be awesome if we could have the design of the website completed before the end of the year. Everyone is welcome
to help! Here is the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msz-H3ONc1WMRa0WWSYaZVomJOe--JhNdCyeV1061SU/edit#)
where you can sign up for a page to design. The link to the Figma file is in the doc.

## Development

As for the website, we will split the work in terms of pages, so the idea would be to create a branch unique to every 
page and keep the main branch as the most stable deliverable. This way, we can work on different pages independently, 
without the risk of creating conflicts on every commit.

We can name our branches in this format:

`feature/{random-page-title}`

If this is your first time cloning this repo, you may want to run this script after importing to install the necessary
packages (from package.json):

`npm install`

Apart from that, these are the scripts you may be using the most:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
